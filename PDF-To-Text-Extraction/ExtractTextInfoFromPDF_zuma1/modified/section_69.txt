13. STUDY DOCUMENTATION AND ARCHIVE
The investigator will maintain a list of qualified staff to whom study responsibilities have been delegated.  These individuals authorized to fulfil these responsibilities should be outlined and included in the Delegation of Authority Form. Source documents are original documents, data and records for which the study data are collected and verified.  Examples of such source documents may include, but are not limited to, hospital records and patient charts, laboratory, pharmacy, radiology and records, subject diaries, microfiches, correspondence and death registries.  CRF entries may be considered as source data if the site of the original data collection is not available.  However, use of the CRFs as source documentation as a routine practice is not recommended. The investigator and study staff are responsible for maintaining a comprehensive and centralized filing system of all subject records that are readily retrieved to be monitored and or audited at any time by the key sponsor contact, regulatory authorities and IRB/IECs. The filing system will include at minimum:  Subject content including ICFs and subject identification lists  Protocols and protocol amendments, IB, copies of pre-study documentation, and all IRB/IEC and sponsor communication  Proof of receipt, experimental treatment flow records and experimental product related correspondence. Original source documents supporting entries into CRFs must be maintained at the site and readily available upon request. No study documents should be discarded without prior written agreement between Kite Pharma and the investigator. Should storage no longer be available to archive source documents or must be moved to an alternative location, the research staff should notify the key sponsor contact prior to the shipping the documents.
