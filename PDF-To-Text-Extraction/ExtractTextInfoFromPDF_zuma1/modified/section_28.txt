7.1. Informed Consent
Before a subject’s participation in the clinical study, the investigator is responsible for obtaining written informed consent from the subject after adequate explanation of the study design, anticipated benefits and the potential risks.  Subjects should sign the most current IRB/IEC approved ICF prior to any study specific activity or procedure is performed. The consent process and the subject’s agreement or refusal to participate in the study is to be documented in the subject’s medical records.  If the subject agrees to participate, the ICF is to be signed and personally dated by the subject and by the person who conducted the informed consent discussion.  The original signed ICF will be retained in accordance with institution policy and IRB/IEC requirements with a copy of the ICF provided to the subject. All subjects who are enrolled into the study should be re-consented with any updated version of the IRB/IEC approved ICF if relevant to their participation in the study.
