3. STUDY DESIGN
3.1. General Study Design Study KTE-C19-101 is a Phase 1-2 multicenter, open-label study evaluating the safety and efficacy of axicabtagene ciloleucel in subjects with refractory NHL.  Study KTE-C19-101 will be separated into 3 distinct phases designated as Phase 1 study, Phase 2 pivotal study (Cohort 1 and Cohort 2), and Phase 2 safety management study (Cohort 3,Cohort 4, Cohort 5, and Cohort 6). Phase 1 Study During Phase 1, approximately 6 to 24 subjects with DLBCL, PMBCL, or TFL will be enrolled to evaluate the safety of axicabtagene ciloleucel regimens.  If the initial regimen is determined to be safe, a higher dose of conditioning chemotherapy may be investigated.  If the regimen is determined to not be safe, reduced doses of conditioning chemotherapy and/or axicabtagene ciloleucel may be explored.  A safety review team (SRT), internal to the study sponsor, will review the safety data and make recommendations on further study conduct of Phase 1 and progression to Phase 2 as depicted in Figure 3 and outlined in Section 9.10. Phase 2 Pivotal Study In Phase 2 pivotal study, subjects will enroll into 2 separate cohorts designated as Cohort 1 and Cohort 2.  Cohort 1 will enroll adult subjects with refractory DLBCL.  Cohort 2 will enroll adult subjects with refractory PMBCL and TFL.  TFL is defined as subjects who received prior chemotherapy for follicular lymphoma. During the Phase 2 pivotal study, an independent data safety monitoring board (DSMB) will meet when 20 and 50 subjects in the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) set of Cohort 1 have had the opportunity to complete the 3 month disease assessment.  The DSMB will review safety and efficacy data and be chartered to make trial conduct recommendations based on an analysis of risk vs. benefit. Phase 2 Safety Management Study (SMS) In the Phase 2 safety management study (SMS), subjects will enroll into 4 separate cohorts designated as Cohort 3, Cohort 4, Cohort 5, and Cohort 6.  Cohort 3 will enroll adult subjects with relapsed or refractory transplant ineligible DLBCL, PMBCL, or TFL.  Cohort 4 will enroll adult subjects with relapsed or refractory DLBCL, PMBCL, TFL, or HGBCL after 2 systemic lines of therapy.  Cohort 5 will enroll adult subjects with relapsed or refractory DLBCL, PMBCL, TFL, or HGBCL after 2 systemic lines of therapy.  Cohort 6 will enroll adult subjects with relapsed or refractory DLBCL, PMBCL, TFL, or HGBCL after 2 systemic lines of therapy. The DSMB will meet to review safety data when 20 subjects in each Cohort 3, Cohort 4, Cohort 5, and Cohort 6 have been treated with axicabtagene ciloleucel and have had the opportunity to be followed for 30 days.  The DSMB may meet more often as needed. Independent of the phase of the study each subject will follow the same study treatment schedule and procedural requirements. Each subject will proceed through the following study periods:  Screening period  Enrollment/Leukapheresis period  Bridging therapy (if applicable, for Phase 2 SMS) or debulking therapy (if applicable, Phase 2 SMS, Cohort 5)  Conditioning chemotherapy period  Investigational product (IP) treatment period  Post treatment assessment period  Long-term follow-up period For study requirements assigned to each study period, please refer to the schedule of assessments (SOA) and Section 7 for details. A study schema is drawn out and described at the end of the protocol synopsis section.
