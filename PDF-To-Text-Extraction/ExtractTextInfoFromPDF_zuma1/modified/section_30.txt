7.3. Medical and Treatment History
Relevant medical history prior to the start of adverse event reporting will be collected.  Relevant medical history is defined as data on the subject’s concurrent medical condition that would be typically shared in a referral letter.  All findings will be recorded in the CRFs. In addition to the medical history, all history related to the subject’s disease, treatment and response to treatment will be collected and must date back to the original diagnosis. For subjects who are being referred from another clinic or institution to the participating research center, copies from the subjects chart should be obtained.
