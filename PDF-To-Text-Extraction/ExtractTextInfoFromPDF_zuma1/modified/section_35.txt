7.8. Bone Marrow Biopsy
Bone marrow aspirate/biopsy will be performed at screening if not previously performed to assess bone marrow involvement.  For subjects with a potential complete response to axicabtagene ciloleucel, a follow-up bone marrow aspirate/biopsy will be performed in subjects presenting with bone marrow involvement prior to therapy or if new abnormalities in the peripheral blood counts or blood smear cause clinical suspicion of bone marrow involvement with lymphoma after treatment.  To confirm a complete response, the bone marrow aspirate and biopsy must show no evidence of disease by morphology or if indeterminate by morphology it must be negative by immunohistochemistry.  Refer to Section 7.10 and Appendix Afor treatment response assessment requirements per the revised IWG Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma (Cheson et al, 2007).  Bone marrow aspirate/biopsy should also be considered to evaluate hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) as indicated in the IB.  A portion of the bone marrow sample collected to evaluate HLH or other toxicities should be submitted to the central laboratory as outlined in the central laboratory manual.
