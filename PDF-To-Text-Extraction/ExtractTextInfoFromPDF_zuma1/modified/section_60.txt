10.4. Statistical Assumptions
Phase 1 Study The primary endpoint for the Phase 1 portion of the study is the incidence of DLT. Phase 2 Pivotal Study Cohorts 1 and 2 of this trial will enroll subjects with chemo-refractory lymphoma, as evidenced by failure to achieve even a transient or partial response to prior biologic and combination chemotherapy or by early recurrence after ASCT. Phase 2 Safety Management Study Analyses of the safety and efficacy endpoints will be descriptive, with no formal statistical testing being performed.  Subject incidence rates of treatment-emergent CRS, neurologic toxicities, axicabtagene ciloleucel-related adverse events, and ORRs will be summarized by cohort.  DOR, PFS, and OS will also be summarized by cohort.
