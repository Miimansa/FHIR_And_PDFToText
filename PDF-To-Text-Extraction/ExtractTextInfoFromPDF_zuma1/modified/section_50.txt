9.7. Pregnancy and Lactation
There is no relevant clinical experience with axicabtagene ciloleucel in pregnant or lactating women, and animal reproductive studies have not been performed.  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test prior to enrollment because of the potentially dangerous effects of the preparative chemotherapy on the fetus.  Women of childbearing potential should be monitored according to local and country-specific regulations. This experimental therapy should not be administered to pregnant women or women who are breastfeeding. Female subjects and female partners of male subjects are recommended to use highly effective contraception (method must achieve an annual failure rate of < 1%) through at least 6 months after conditioning chemotherapy dosing or axicabtagene ciloleucel dosing, whichever is longer. Male subjects are recommended not to father a child for at least 6 months after completing conditioning chemotherapy dosing or axicabtagene ciloleucel dosing, whichever is longer. If a pregnancy occurs in a female subject enrolled into the study, or a female partner of a male subject, within 6 months of completing the conditioning chemotherapy or axicabtagene ciloleucel dosing (whichever is longer), the pregnancy must be reported to the key sponsor contact.  Information regarding the pregnancy and/or the outcome may be requested by the key sponsor. The pregnancy should be reported to the key sponsor contact within 24 hours of the investigator’s knowledge of the pregnancy event. If a lactation case occurs while the female subject is taking protocol required therapies report the lactation case to the key sponsor contact. In addition to reporting a lactation case during the study, investigators should monitor for lactation cases that occur after the last dose of protocol required therapies through 6 months. Any lactation case should be reported to the key sponsor contact within 24 hours of the investigator’s knowledge of the event.
