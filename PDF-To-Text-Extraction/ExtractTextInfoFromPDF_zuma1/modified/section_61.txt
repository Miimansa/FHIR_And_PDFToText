10.5. Analysis Subsets
10.5.1. Phase 1 Study Depending on the dosing cohort and results of the Phase 1 portion of the study, axicabtagene ciloleucel may be:  administered as a single infusion at a target dose of 2 x 106 anti-CD19 CAR T cells/kg (± 20%).  For subjects weighing greater than 100 kg, a maximum flat dose of 2 x 108 anti-CD19 CAR T cells will be administered. A minimum dose of 1 x 106 anti-CD19 CAR T cells/kg may be administered; or  administered as a single infusion at a target dose of 1 x 106 anti-CD19 CAR T cells/kg (± 20%) in the Phase 2 portion of the study. In this case, for subjects weighing greater than CC  anti-CD19 CAR T cells will be administered. A CC  anti-CD19 CAR T cells/kg may be administered. The DLT evaluable set (Phase 1 only), defined for each dosing cohort in Phase 1, will include subjects treated in the Phase 1 dosing cohort who:  received the target and were followed for at least 30 days after the anti-CD19 CAR T cell infusion; or  received a dose of anti-CD19 CAR T cells lower than the target for that cohort and experienced a DLT during the 30 day post-infusion period. If needed, more subjects will be enrolled to achieve 6 DLT evaluable subjects at the target dose for each cohort. Safety set:  the safety set is defined as all subjects treated with any dose of axicabtagene ciloleucel. 10.5.2. Phase 2 Study In the Phase 2 portion of the study (including the Phase 2 pivotal study and SMS), subjects are to be dosed at a target of 2 x 106 anti-CD19 CAR T cells/kg.  A minimum dose of 1 x 106 anti-CD19 CAR T cells/kg may be administered. For subjects weighing greater than 100 kg, a maximum flat dose of 2 x 108 anti-CD19 CAR T cells will be administered.  Subjects are considered to have received the target dose if they receive 1 x 106 anti-CD19 CAR T cells/kg up to 2 x 106 anti-CD19 CAR T cells/kg or, if the subject weighs more than 100 kg, the subject receives 2 x 108 anti-CD19 CAR T cells. Modified Intent-to-Treat Set:  the mITT set will consist of all subjects enrolled and treated with axicabtagene ciloleucel at a dose of at least 1 x 106 anti-CD19 CAR T cells/kg. This analysis set will be used for all analyses of objective response and endpoints based on objective response (objective response, duration of response, progression-free survival) for both the Phase 1 and Phase 2 portions of the study (including both pivotal and SMS). Safety analysis set:  the safety analysis set is defined as all subjects treated with any dose of axicabtagene ciloleucel. Full Analysis set (FAS):  the full analysis set will consist of all enrolled subjects and will be used for the summary of subject disposition, sensitivity analyses of ORR and DOR, and subject listings of deaths.
