5. SUBJECT ELIGIBILITY
5.1. Inclusion Criteria 101) Histologically confirmed aggressive B cell NHL, including the following types defined by WHO 2008 (Campo et al, 2011):  DLBCL not otherwise specified; T cell/histiocyte rich large B cell lymphoma; DLBCL associated with chronic inflammation; Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)+ DLBCL of the elderly; or  primary mediastinal (thymic) large B cell lymphoma  transformation of follicular lymphoma to DLBCL will also be included 102) Chemotherapy-refractory disease, defined as one or more of the following:  No response to first-line therapy (primary refractory disease); subjects who are intolerant to first-line therapy chemotherapy are excluded  Progressive disease (PD) as best response to first-line therapy  Stable disease (SD) as best response after at least 4 cycles of first-line therapy (e.g., 4 cycles of R-CHOP) with SD duration no longer than 6 months from last dose of therapy or  No response to second or greater lines of therapy  PD as best response to most recent therapy regimen  SD as best response after at least 2 cycles of last line of therapy with SD duration no longer than 6 months from last dose of therapy or  Refractory post-ASCT  Disease progression or relapsed ≤ 12 months of ASCT (must have biopsy proven recurrence in relapsed subjects)  if salvage therapy is given post-ASCT, the subject must have had no response to or relapsed after the last line of therapy 103) Subjects must have received adequate prior therapy including at a minimum: a) anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody unless investigator determines that tumor is CD20 negative, and b) an anthracycline containing chemotherapy regimen; c) for subjects with transformed FL must have chemorefractory disease after transformation to DLBCL 104) At least 1 measurable lesion according to the revised International Working Group (IWG) Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma (Cheson et al, 2007).  Lesions that have been previously irradiated will be considered measurable only if progression has been documented following completion of radiation therapy 105) Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showing no evidence of central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma 106) At least 2 weeks or 5 half-lives, whichever is shorter, must have elapsed since any prior systemic therapy at the time the subject is planned for leukapheresis, except for systemic inhibitory/stimulatory immune checkpoint therapy. At least 3 half-lives must have elapsed from any prior systemic inhibitory/stimulatory immune checkpoint molecule therapy at the time the subject is planned for leukapheresis (e.g. ipilimumab, nivolumab, pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, OX40 agonists, 4-1BB agonists, etc). 107) Toxicities due to prior therapy must be stable and recovered to ≤ Grade 1 (except for clinically non-significant toxicities such as alopecia) 108) Age 18 or older 109) Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1 110) Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1000/uL 111) Platelet count ≥ 75,000/uL 112) Absolute lymphocyte count ≥ 100/uL 113) Adequate renal, hepatic, pulmonary and cardiac function defined as: a) Creatinine clearance (as estimated by Cockcroft Gault) ≥ 60 mL/min b) Serum alanine aminotransferase/aspartate aminotransferase (ALT/AST) ≤ 2.5 upper limit of normal (ULN) c) Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 mg/dl, except in subjects with Gilbert’s syndrome d) Cardiac ejection fraction ≥ 50%, no evidence of pericardial effusion as determined by an echocardiogram (ECHO), and no clinically significant electrocardiogram (ECG) findings e) No clinically significant pleural effusion f) Baseline oxygen saturation >92% on room air 114) Females of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test  (females who have undergone surgical sterilization or who have been postmenopausal for at least 2 years are not considered to be of childbearing potential) Additional criteria specific for Phase 2 safety management study (Cohorts 3, 4, 5 and 6): 115) Relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma including DLBCL, PMBCL, TFL, and HGBCL after two systemic lines of therapy
