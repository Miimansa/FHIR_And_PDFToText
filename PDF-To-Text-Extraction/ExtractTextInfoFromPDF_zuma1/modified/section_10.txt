2. DISEASE BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is a heterogeneous group of cancers originating in B lymphocytes, T lymphocytes or natural killer cells.  In the United States, B cell lymphomas represent 80-85% of cases reported.  In 2013, approximately 69,740 new cases of NHL and over 19,000 deaths related to the disease were estimated to occur.  Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is the most prevalent hematological malignancy and is the seventh leading site of new cancers among men and women and account for 4% of all new cancer cases and 3% of deaths related to cancer (Howlader et al, 2017).  Large B-cell lymphomas represent the most common sub-group of NHL (Rodriguez-Abreu et al, 2007).
