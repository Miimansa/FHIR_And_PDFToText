 Within Cohort 1, CCI one primary analyses will be performed. CCI ï‚· The primary analysis of Cohort 1 will occur after 72 subjects in the mITT set have had the opportunity to be assessed for response 6 months after the axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion. CCI For Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 combined, 1 primary analysis will be performed when 72 subjects in the mITT set in Cohort 1 and 20 subjects in the mITT set in Cohort 2 have had the opportunity to be assessed for response 6 months after the axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion. Phase 2 Safety Management Study The primary objective of Cohort 3 is to assess the impact of prophylactic regimens on the rate and severity of CRS and neurologic toxicities. The primary objective of Cohort 4 is to assess the impact of earlier interventions on the incidence and severity of CRS and neurologic toxicities. The primary objective of Cohort 5 is to assess the impact of debulking therapy on the incidence and severity of CRS and neurologic toxicities. The primary objective of Cohort 6 is to assess the impact of prophylactic steroid use and earlier interventions on the incidence and severity of CRS and neurologic toxicities. The secondary objectives of Cohort 3, Cohort 4, Cohort 5, and Cohort 6 include assessment of efficacy endpoints (ORR, DOR, PFS, OS) and levels of anti-CD19 CAR T cells and cytokines in the blood. Analyses of the safety and efficacy endpoints of this portion of the study will be entirely descriptive, with no formal statistical testing being performed.
