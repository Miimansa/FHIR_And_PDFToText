7.10. Disease Response Assessment
Subjects will be evaluated for disease response by the site investigator at times indicated in the SOA.  Disease assessments will be evaluated per the revised IWG Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma (Cheson et al, 2007).  Flow cytometric, molecular or cytogenetic studies will not be used to determine response. Baseline positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) scans of the neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis, along with the appropriate imaging of all other sites of disease are required.  Subjects will undergo additional PET-CT tumor assessments after their axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion.  The first of these post-treatment PET-CT tumor assessments will occur 4 weeks after infusion; subsequent assessments will occur at regular intervals throughout the post-treatment and long-term follow-up portions of the study, as highlighted in the SOA. After axicabtagene ciloleucel administration, disease assessments will be used to determine the time when progressive disease occurs.  Subjects with symptoms suggestive of disease progression should be evaluated for progression at the time symptoms occur even if it is off schedule as per the SOA. A bone marrow aspirate and biopsy will be performed in subjects who are being assessed for CR. Per the revised IWG Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma (Cheson et al, 2007), a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy should be performed only when the subject had bone marrow involvement with lymphoma prior to therapy or if new abnormalities in the peripheral blood counts or blood smear cause clinical suspicion of bone marrow involvement with lymphoma after treatment.  The bone marrow aspirate and biopsy must show no evidence of disease by morphology, or if indeterminate by morphology, it must be negative by immunohistochemistry to assign a CR to treatment. In addition to the investigatorâ€™s assessment, PET-CT scans of all subjects evaluated for disease response for Phase 2 pivotal study (Cohort 1 and Cohort 2) will be submitted to and reviewed by an independent central reviewer.  For subjects who discontinue the study due to an assessment of progressive disease which was not subsequently confirmed by a central radiology reviewer, any additional imaging data, subsequent to the image in question will be submitted to the central reviewer to confirm disease response. If the subject is eligible for retreatment with axicabtagene ciloleucel, the last scan prior to retreatment will be considered the baseline for the purpose of evaluating the response to retreatment. Requirements for PET-CT scans and shipping requirements will be outlined in the study imaging manual.
