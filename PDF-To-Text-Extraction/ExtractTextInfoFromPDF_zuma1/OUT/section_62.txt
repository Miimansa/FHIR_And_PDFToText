10.6. Access to Individual Subject Treatment Assignments
This is a single arm, open-label study and subjects and investigators will be aware of treatment received.  Data handling procedures for the Phase 2 portion of the study will be devised to reduce potential sources of bias and maintain the validity and credibility of the study.
