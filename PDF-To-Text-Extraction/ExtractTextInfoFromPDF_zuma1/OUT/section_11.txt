2.1. Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma
DLBCL is the most common subtype of large B-cell lymphoma, accounting for approximately 30% of NHL cases.  There are approximately 22,000 new diagnoses of DLBCL in the United States each year.  In the past two decades, progress has been made in understanding the biological heterogeneity of DLBCL and in improving survival with combinations of CHOP and immunotherapy.  The addition of rituximab into combination therapies for DLBCL have greatly improved patient outcomes.  However, patients with chemotherapy-refractory DLBCL following treatment under the current standards of care still have a particularly dire prognosis, with no curative treatment options (Flowers et al, 2010). The population with the highest unmet need continues to consist of patients who do not respond to first line combination chemotherapy (typically R-CHOP) or who do not respond to their last course of combination chemotherapy, as the disease is mostly insensitive to subsequent combination chemotherapy (typically R-ICE, R-ESHAP) (Table 1).  In a review of 64 patients with DLBCL with disease progression during first line chemotherapy or only transient response (â‰¤90 days) after end of induction treatment, the response rate to second line therapy was 15% and the median overall survival (OS) was 6 months, and no patient survived more than 26 months after first diagnosis (Josting et al, 2000).  An analysis of outcome in 1126 patients with DLBCL after first line R-CHOP included 33 patients with primary refractory DLBCL who received second line therapy with curative intent.  Only 3 (9%) patients were able to receive autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT), and only 1 (3%) patient achieved long term survival (Hitz et al, 2010).  Seshadri et al analyzed 120 patients who did not respond to second line platinum-based chemotherapy regimens (e.g., R-ICE) and showed that only 14% responded to their third line therapy (Seshadri et al, 2008).  Ardeshna et al followed 19 patients with large B-cell lymphoma, and 9 patients with TFL who did not respond to second line chemotherapy.  Only 5 of the 28 total patients (18%) responded to third line chemotherapy (Ardeshna et al, 2005). Table 1. Historical Responses in Refractory NHL (SD or PD to Last Line of Therapy)

These consistently discouraging results demonstrate that new treatment options are urgently needed for patients whose tumors have demonstrated a lack of response to chemotherapy. This trial will enroll patients with chemo-refractory lymphoma, as evidenced by failure to achieve even a transient or partial response to prior biologic and combination chemotherapy or by early recurrence after ASCT.
