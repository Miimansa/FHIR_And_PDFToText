2.4. Study Rationale
As most advanced cancers eventually become refractory to conventional therapies, new treatment modalities are needed.  Immunotherapy, which is based on the enhancement of an immune response against the tumor, is a promising approach to treating many cancer types.  T cells play an important role in destroying diseased cells throughout the body.  Studies with immune checkpoint inhibitors and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes have demonstrated the potential of T cells to treat cancer.  T cells need to possess the appropriate specificity for a tumor, be present in sufficient numbers, and overcome any local immunosuppressive factors to be effective.  Engineered T cells are a promising approach for cancer therapy (Kershaw et al, 2013). Engineered autologous cell therapy (eACT™) is a process by which a patient’s own T cells are collected and subsequently genetically altered to recognize and target antigens expressed on the cell surface of specific malignancies (Kochenderfer et al, 2013).  The ability to genetically engineer human T cells and use them to mediate cancer regression in patients has been demonstrated in a number of studies and has opened possibilities for the treatment of patients with a wide variety of cancer types including B cell malignancies expressing the CD19 antigen. 2.4.1. CD19 and Expression CD19 is a 95 kDa transmembrane protein expressed only in the B cell lineage.  It is expressed in all normal B cells starting at the pre-B cell stage until the final differentiation stage and is not expressed in pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells or most plasma cells.  The pattern of CD19 expression is maintained in B cell malignancies including all subtypes of B cell NHL, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and non-T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (Blanc et al, 2011) with the exception of multiple myeloma. 2.4.2. Anti-CD19 CAR T-cell Product Anti-CD19 CAR T cells are autologous human T cells that have been engineered to express an extracellular single-chain variable fragment (scFv) with specificity for CD19 linked to an intracellular signaling part comprised of signaling domains from CD28 and CD3ζ (CD3-zeta) molecules arranged in tandem. An anti-CD19 CAR vector construct has been designed, optimized and initially tested at the Surgery Branch of the National Cancer Institute (NCI, IND 13871) (Figure 2) (Kochenderfer et al, 2009; Kochenderfer et al, 2010).  The scFv is derived from the variable region of the anti-CD19 monoclonal antibody FMC63 (Nicholson et al, 1997).  A portion of the CD28 costimulatory molecule is added, as murine models suggest this is important for the anti-tumor effect and persistence of anti-CD19 CAR T cells (Kowolik et al, 2006).  The signaling domain of the CD3-zeta chain is essential for T cell activation.  These fragments were cloned into the murine stem CCI  vector, utilized to genetically engineer the autologous T cells.  Treatment with anti-CD19 CAR T cells is currently being administered to subjects with CD19+ B cell malignancies in ongoing NCI protocol (09-C-0082; IND 13871). CCI The CAR construct is inserted into the T cells’ genome by retroviral vector transduction.  Briefly, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are obtained by leukapheresis and Ficoll separation.  CCI Figure 2. Axicabtagene Ciloleucel 2.4.3. Prior Experience with Axicabtagene Ciloleucel and other Anti-CD19 CAR T Cells Refer to the current axicabtagene ciloleucel Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for the most current anti-CD19 CAR T-cell study results. 2.4.4. Axicabtagene Ciloleucel Kite Pharma, Inc., (hereafter referred to as Kite Pharma or Kite) is developing an eACT™ (axicabtagene ciloleucel) that targets CD19 expression on B cell malignancies. CCI Kite Pharma in conjunction with the NCI Surgery Branch has developed a rapid, closed, and bead-less process for the generation of the anti-CD19 CAR T cells.  Closing the process retains the characteristics of the T cell product (Better et al, 2014).  See the investigational product manual for more details.
