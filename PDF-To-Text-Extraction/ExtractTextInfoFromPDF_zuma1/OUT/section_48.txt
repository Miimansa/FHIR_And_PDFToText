9.5. Reporting Deaths
Deaths that occur during the protocol-specified adverse event reporting period that are attributed by the investigator solely to progression of underlying lymphoma should be recorded as serious adverse events (SAEs) with the preferred term “B-cell lymphoma” and must be reported immediately to the sponsor.  Death is an outcome and not a distinct event.  The event or condition that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be recorded on the AE form.  The term “unexplained death” should be captured if the cause of death is not known.  However, every effort should be made to capture the established cause of death, which may become available later on (eg, after autopsy). Deaths during the post-study survival follow-up due to underlying cancer should be recorded only on the Survival Status CRF.
