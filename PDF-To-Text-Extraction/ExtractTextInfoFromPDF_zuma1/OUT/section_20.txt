4. SUBJECT SCREENING AND ENROLLMENT
All subjects must sign and date the Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee (IRB/IEC) approved consent form before initiating any study specific procedures or activities that are not part of a subjectâ€™s routine care.  Refer to Section 7 for details. Each subject who enters the screening period, which starts when the subject signs the informed consent form (ICF), will receive a unique subject identification (ID) number before any study specific procedures or activities are initiated.  This number will be used to identify the subject throughout the study and must be used on all study documentation related to the subject.  Furthermore, the subject identification number must remain constant throughout the entire clinical study, it must not be changed after enrollment or if the subject is rescreened or retreated.
