2.2. Primary Mediastinal B-cell Lymphoma and Transformed Follicular Lymphoma
PMBCL has distinct clinical, pathological, and molecular characteristics compared to DLBCL.  PMBCL is thought to arise from thymic (medullary) B cells and represents approximately 3% of patients diagnosed with large B-cell lymphoma.  PMBCL is typically identified in the younger adult population in the fourth decade of life with a slight female predominance (Sehn et al, 1998; Savage et al, 2006).  Gene expression profiling suggests deregulated pathways in PMBCL overlap with Hodgkin lymphoma.  Initial therapy of PMBCL generally includes anthracycline-containing regimens with rituximab with or without involved field radiotherapy.  A recent Phase 2, prospective study of infusional dose-adjusted etoposide, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide with vincristine, prednisone, and rituximab (DA-EPOCH-R) demonstrated radiotherapy may not be required (Dunleavy et al, 2013). Follicular lymphoma (FL), a B cell lymphoma, is the most common indolent (slow-growing) form of NHL, accounting for approximately 20% to 30% of all NHLs.  Some patients with FL will transform (TFL) histologically to DLBCL which is more aggressive and associated with a poor outcome.  Histological transformation to DLBCL occurs at an annual rate of approximately 3% for 15 years with the risk of transformation continuing to drop in subsequent years.  The biologic mechanism of histologic transformation is unknown.  Initial treatment of TFL is influenced by prior therapies for follicular lymphoma but generally includes anthracycline-containing regimens with rituximab to eliminate the aggressive component of the disease (National Comprehensive Cancer Network 2014). Treatment options for relapsed/refractory PMBCL and TFL are similar to those in DLBCL.  Given the low prevalence of these diseases, no large prospective randomized studies in these patient populations have been conducted.  Patients with chemotherapy refractory disease have a similar or worse prognosis (Kuruvilla et al, 2008) to those with refractory DLBCL. In addition, the international, multicohort retrospective non-Hodgkin lymphoma research (SCHOLAR-1) study retrospectively evaluated outcomes in patients with chemorefractory DLBCL, PMBCL, and TFL.  SCHOLAR-1 integrated data from two Phase 3 studies (LYSARC-CORAL and Canadian Cancer Trials Group LY.12) and 2 observational cohorts (MD Anderson Cancer Center and Mayo Clinic/University of Iowa Specialized Program of Research Excellence).  Among 861 patients, 635 were included based on chemorefractory search criteria.  Outcomes were consistently poor, regardless of refractory subgroup and across cohorts. The results of SCHOLAR-1 indicated that patients with chemorefractory, aggressive DLBCL represent a homogenous patient population with a response rate of 26% (complete response [CR] rate of 7%) and median overall survival of 6.3 months (Crump et al, 2017).
