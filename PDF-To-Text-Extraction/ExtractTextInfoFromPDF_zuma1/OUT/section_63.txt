Phase 2 Pivotal Study An independent DSMB will be formed to review accumulating safety and efficacy data CCI The DSMB will also monitor criteria to pause enrollment (see Section 9.12). Phase 2 Safety Management Study The DSMB will review safety data when 20 subjects treated in Cohort 3, Cohort 4, Cohort 5, and Cohort 6 have had the opportunity to be followed for 30 days, respectively. 10.7.2.

The DSMB may request additional safety data or to modify the study conduct.  The sponsor may request additional reviews by the DSMB if safety concerns are identified. Data submitted to the DSMB may be monitored or unmonitored to facilitate timely DSMB review.
