10.1. Hypothesis
Phase 2 pivotal study Cohort 1 and Cohort 2:  This study is designed to differentiate between a treatment that has a true response rate of 20% or less and a treatment with a true response rate of 40% or more.  The hypothesis is that the ORR to axicabtagene ciloleucel in Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 is significantly greater than 20%. Phase 2 safety management study Cohort 3, Cohort 4, Cohort 5, and Cohort 6:  No hypothesis will be tested in Cohort 3, Cohort 4, Cohort 5, and Cohort 6, which will be used to assess the impact of prophylactic regimens, earlier interventions, debulking therapy, or prophylactic steroids on the rate and severity of CRS and neurologic toxicities.
