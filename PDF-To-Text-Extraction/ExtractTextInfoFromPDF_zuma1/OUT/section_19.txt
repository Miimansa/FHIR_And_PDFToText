3.5. Study Duration
3.5.1. Study Duration for Individual Subjects The duration of the study for individual subjects will vary.  For a subject who completes the entire protocol from the date of informed consent through the completion of the long term follow-up period, the duration of the study will take approximately 15 years to complete.  However, individual study duration will vary depending on a subjectâ€™s screening requirements, response to treatment and survival. The need for prolonged follow-up is based on the potential persistence of gene transfer vectors in treated subjects. 3.5.2. Completion of the Phase 2 Pivotal Study Completion of the study is defined as the time at which the last subject completes the long-term follow-up period visit, is considered lost to follow-up, withdraws consent, or dies.  The primary analyses will be conducted when 72 subjects in the mITT set of the Phase 2 pivotal Cohort 1 and 20 subjects in the mITT set of Cohort 2 have completed the 6 month disease response assessment, are lost to follow-up, withdraw from the study, or die, whichever occurs first.
