2.3. High Grade B-cell Lymphoma
In 2016, the World Health Organization introduced a new category of large B-cell lymphomas called high-grade B-cell lymphoma (HGBCL) (Swerdlow et al, 2016).  This designation includes large B-cell lymphomas with MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements that are phenotypically intermediate to DLBCL or B-cell lymphoma, unclassifiable (this latter category has since been eliminated).  MYC rearrangements in large B-cell lymphomas are associated with a poor prognosis that is worsened in cases of concomitant BCL2 and/or BCL6 alterations, ie, double- or triple-hit lymphomas.  As such, patients with HGBCL are likely to face poor survival outcomes. In summary, axicabtagene ciloleucel may provide a viable treatment option to relapsed/refractory large B-cell lymphoma patients with no other curative alternatives.
