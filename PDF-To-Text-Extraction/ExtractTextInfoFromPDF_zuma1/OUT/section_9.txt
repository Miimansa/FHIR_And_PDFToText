1. OBJECTIVES
The primary objective of Phase 1 study is to evaluate the safety of axicabtagene ciloleucel regimens. The primary objective of Phase 2 pivotal study is to evaluate the efficacy of axicabtagene ciloleucel, as measured by objective response rate (ORR) in subjects with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL), and transformed follicular lymphoma (TFL).  Secondary objectives will include assessing the safety and tolerability of axicabtagene ciloleucel and additional efficacy endpoints. The primary objective of the Phase 2 safety management study is to assess the impact of a prophylactic regimen, earlier interventions, debulking therapy, or prophylactic steroid use on the rate and severity of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurologic toxicities.  The key secondary objectives include assessment of efficacy, levels of anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, cytokines in blood/serum, and the change in European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) scores from baseline to Month 6.
