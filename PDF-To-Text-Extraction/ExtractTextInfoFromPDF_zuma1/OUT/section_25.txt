6.3. Study Treatment Schedule
6.3.1. Leukapheresis (Within Approximately 5 Days of Eligibility Confirmation) Subjects will undergo leukapheresis to obtain leukocytes (white blood cells) for the manufacturing of axicabtagene ciloleucel.  Leukapheresed cells obtained at participating centers will be shipped to the cell processing facility (CPF) overnight as described in the Investigational Product Manual.  Once a subject commences leukapheresis, the subject is considered enrolled in the study. Mononuclear cells will be obtained by leukapheresis (CCI  with a goal to target CC  mononuclear cells).  The leukapheresed cells are then packaged for expedited shipment to the CPF as described in the investigational product manual. Upon arrival at the CPF, each subject’s leukapheresed product will be processed to enrich for the T cells containing PBMC fraction.  T cells are then stimulated to expand and transduced with a retroviral vector to introduce the CAR gene.  The T cells are then expanded and cryopreserved to generate the investigational product per CPF standard operating procedures (SOPs).  Once the product has passed certain release tests, it will be shipped back to the treating facility.  Following completion of each subject’s conditioning chemotherapy regimen, subjects will receive their respective axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion. 6.3.2. Study Treatment 6.3.2.1. Chemotherapy General Instructions Subjects will receive a non-myeloablative conditioning regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine in order to induce lymphocyte depletion and create an optimal environment for expansion of axicabtagene ciloleucel in vivo.  Subjects will initiate conditioning chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine beginning on Day -5 (or Day -7 for Cohort B) through Day -1.  The 5-day conditioning chemotherapy regimen may be administered in an outpatient setting.  The 7-day conditioning chemotherapy regimen may be administered as an outpatient or inpatient regimen per investigator’s discretion. Subjects should be instructed to drink plenty of liquids during and for 24 hours following the chemotherapy.  In general, subjects should be kept well-hydrated but closely monitored to prevent fluid overload. For subjects enrolled into the Phase 2 Safety Management Study, Cohort 5 and Cohort 6: Subjects who have not recovered their white blood cell (WBC) count by the time conditioning chemotherapy is scheduled to start, may skip the conditioning chemotherapy if the WBC is ≤ 1000/µL at this time. This option must be discussed with the Kite medical monitor. 6.3.2.2. Axicabtagene Ciloleucel General Instructions All subjects will receive axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion at a healthcare facility, followed by daily monitoring at a healthcare facility for at least 7 days unless otherwise required by country regulatory agencies (refer to Appendix B) to monitor for signs and symptoms of CRS and neurologic toxicities.  Subjects should be instructed to remain within proximity of the clinical study site for at least 4 weeks following axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion.  Subjects and their family members/caregivers should be educated on potential CRS and neurologic symptoms, such as fever, dyspnea, confusion, aphasia, dysphasia, somnolence, encephalopathy, ataxia, or tremor.  Subjects or their family members/caregivers should be instructed to immediately contact the treating investigator or seek immediate medical attention if any of these symptoms develop. Alternatively, subjects may be hospitalized to receive their axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion and be observed for CRS and neurologic toxicities in the hospital setting, if deemed appropriate by the investigator. If subjects are hospitalized, subjects should not be discharged from the hospital until all axicabtagene ciloleucel-related non-hematological toxicities resolve to ≤ Grade 1 or return to baseline.  Subjects may be discharged with non-critical and clinically stable or improving toxicities (e.g., renal insufficiency) even if > Grade 1, if deemed appropriate by the investigator.  Subjects should remain in a hospital for ongoing axicabtagene ciloleucel-related fever, hypotension, hypoxia, or ongoing neurologic toxicities > Grade 1, or if deemed necessary by the investigator. The following medications should be administered approximately 1 hour prior to axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion.  Alternatives to the recommendations below should be discussed with the medical monitor.  Diphenhydramine (CCI  PO) Central venous access, such as a port or a peripherally inserted central catheter, is required for the administration of axicabtagene ciloleucel.  Catheter care, per institutional guidelines, should be followed.  Materials and instructions for the thawing, timing, and administering of axicabtagene ciloleucel are outlined in the Investigational Product Manual.  The Investigational Product Manual must be reviewed prior to administration of axicabtagene ciloleucel. Research sites should follow institutional guidelines for the infusion of cell products. 6.3.3. Rationale for Study Treatment Dosing 6.3.3.1. Rationale for Conditioning Chemotherapy Dose in Phase 1 Cohort A1 Increasing levels of conditioning chemotherapy correlates with clinical responses to adoptive cell therapy (Dudley et al, 2008).  Specifically, there appears to be a link between adequate lymphodepletion and adoptively transferred T cell expansion and function in pre-clinical models.  The depth and duration of the lymphodepletion in preclinical models correlate with anti-tumor activity of the adoptively transferred tumor-specific CD8+ T cells (Gattinoni et al, 2005).  Lymphodepletion may function by eradicating cytokine sinks for the transferred cells, eliminating T regulatory cells, or enhancing antigen presenting cell activation (Klebanoff et al, 2005).  Cyclophosphamide and fludarabine is a potent lymphodepleting regimen.  Optimizing the doses of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine to improve the depth and duration of lymphodepletion may enhance the activity of axicabtagene ciloleucel. As described in the IB, the NCI study (09-C-0082; IND 13871) evaluated three groups of subjects based on conditioning regimens.  Group 3 evaluated cyclophosphamide (300 mg/m2) and fludarabine (30 mg/m2), both given for 3 concurrent days followed by 1-2 x 106 anti-CD19 CAR T cells.  Eleven subjects were treated with this regimen. The DLT definition in the KTE-C19-101 study was applied to the NCI study (09-C-0082; IND 13871) data in group 3.  There were no DLTs.  The subject incidences of Grade 3, 4, 5, and serious adverse events attributed to CAR+ T-cells were 3 (27%), 0 (0%), 0 (0%), and 1 (9%).  The ORR in this cohort was 60%, including 10% complete responses.  Many subjects, however, did not achieve blood lymphocyte counts of zero with this conditioning regimen. To improve the depth and duration of lymphocyte depletion, the conditioning chemotherapy dose in Phase 1 Cohort A1 will be cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2) and fludarabine (30 mg/m2) both given for 3 concurrent days with the target dose of 2 x 106 anti-CD19 CAR T cells/kg.  This regimen is currently being evaluated in the NCI study (09-C-0082; IND 13871). Cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2) and fludarabine (30 mg/m2) both given for 3 concurrent days has been studied and tolerated in subjects with B cell malignancies (O'Brien et al, 2001). Similar total doses of cyclophosphamide (900 to 2,000 mg/m2) and fludarabine (90 to 150 mg/m2) have been given as a reduced non-myeloblative conditioning regimen in subjects with B cell malignancies receiving allogeneic stem cell transplants (Khouri et al, 1998). The cyclophosphamide dose used in this regimen (Cohoit Al and currently in the NCI study 09-C-0082; IND 1387) is approximately 38% lower than that used in the Group 2 cyclophosphamide 30 mg/kg conditioning regimen from the NCI study (incidence ofDLT 29%), with the same lower dose of fludarabine dose as Group 3. Evaluation of higher conditioning chemotherapy doses and/or varying anti-CD19 CART cell doses would proceed based on the incidence of DLT and evaluation of benefit-risk. 6.3.3.2. Rationale for Conditioning Chemotherapy Dose in Phase 1 Coholi B 1 Fifteen subjects were treated in the NCI protocol (09-C-0082; IND 13871) in group 2. Grnup 2 included subjects with leukemia and lymphoma, 2 different doses of cyclophosphamide and a range of CART cell doses _)_ The DLT definition in the KTE-C19-101 study was applied to the NCI study data for subjects in group 2 with B-cell lymphomas, dosed at :S 2.5 x 106 anti-CD19 CART cells, and dose of cyclophosphamide to reflect the KTE-C19-101 protocol. Seven subjects met these DLT criteria. The subject incidence of DLT was 29%.

The Grade 4 events were Grade 4 hypotension, Grade 4 somnolence, and Grade 4 aphasia/dysphasia (3 events in 2 subjects) (data on file, Kite Pharma). The subject incidence ORR in this cohort was 6 (86%), including 5 (71%) complete responses of which 4 am ongomg. The duration and depth of lymphodepletion appeared to be improved with this higher dose of cyclophosphamide conditioning chemotherapy (data on file, Kite Pha1ma). While the sample sizes are small, the data suggest that greater objective and complete response rates may be attained with a higher dose of conditioning chemotherapy regimen. Therefore, the regimen in Cohmi Bl may be explored if the incidence of DLT in Cohort Al is acceptable to further evaluate the impact of conditioning chemotherapy on benefit/risk.

 6.3.3.3. Rationale for Patient Population to be Included in Phase 2 Pivotal Study Cohort 1 andCoh0112 In the multicenter randomized Phase 3 CORAL study where subjects were randomized to R-ICE or R-DHAP second-line therapy followed by ASCT with or without rituximab maintenance, 203 subjects across both anns did not proceed with ASCT. These subjects were ineligible for ASCT for multiple reasons including chemorefractmy disease, early relapsed disease, residual masses after salvage therapy and intolerance to therapy. The median overall survival of these 203 ASCT ineligible subjects after salvage chemotherapy was only 4.4 months (Van Den Neste et al, 2016). Therefore, the efficacy of axicabtagene ciloleucel will be estimated in this population which represents a significant unmet need for more effective therapies.

 CRS and neurologic toxicities are two identified risks associated with axicabtagene ciloleucel. Both CRS and neurologic toxicities have led to Grade 4 or Grade 5 events in the context of anti-CD19 CART cells (Schuster et al, 2015; Turtle et al, 2016). The pathophysiology of CRS CONFIDENTIAL Page 46 of 118 11 Febmary 2019 is well described, but the etiology of the neurologic toxicities remains unclear.  Currently it is hypothesized that there are two potential mechanisms of the pathophysiology of neurologic toxicities:  1) peripheral systemic cytokine release followed by cytokine diffusion across the blood brain barrier (BBB) and/or 2) peripherally activated anti-CD19 CAR T cells translocate across the BBB and elicits a local inflammatory effect.  The later hypothesis is supported by emerging evidence of CAR T-cells trafficking to the CSF.  To further elucidate the pathophysiology of neurologic toxicities, serial CSF collections will be analyzed in this study for cytokines/chemokines/effector molecules and anti-CD19 CAR T cells. In addition, in an attempt to mitigate the onset and severity of CRS and neurologic toxicities, prophylactic tocilizumab and levetiracetam will be administered in Cohort 3 (see Section 6.3.4).  It is hypothesized that tocilizumab may lead to fewer activated CAR T-cells trafficking to the CNS and levetiracetam may reduce the risk of clinical or subclinical seizures.  Lastly, in an effort to mitigate the severity and/or duration of the neurologic toxicities, IT-Ara C with corticosteroids is recommended to be administered at the onset of Grade 3 neurologic toxicities (see Section 6.4.1). 6.3.3.4.2. Cohort 4 and Cohort 6 In the Phase 2 pivotal study portion of ZUMA-1 (n = 101), CAR T-cell levels were associated with response (P = 0.0002), with a 5.4-fold higher area under the curve (AUC) within the first 28 days post-treatment for responders versus non-responders.  However, CAR T-cell levels and specific cytokines, including IL-2, GM-CSF, and ferritin, were only associated with Grade 3 or higher neurologic toxicity suggesting that distinct mechanisms may underlie the pathogenesis of these adverse events, as shown in Figure 4 and (Locke et al, 2017). While there is a theoretical concern for the use of immunosuppressive agents to manage CRS or neurologic toxicities, tocilizumab and/or corticosteroids usage did not appear to affect negatively the overall response in ZUMA-1 and CAR T-cell levels (Table 6).  Prophylactic tocilizumab use in Cohort 3 appeared to lower the rate of Grade 3 or higher CRS but not neurologic toxicities (Table 7).  To further refine the use of corticosteroids to treat CRS and neurologic toxicities, Cohort 4 and Cohort 6 will recommend corticosteroids at lower toxicity grades to determine the impact on incidence and severity of CRS and neurologic toxicities (Section 6.4.1).  Cohort 6 will further build on this rationale by initiating corticosteroids as prophylactic treatment on Day 0, Day 1, and Day 2. Prophylactic tocilizumab will not be used in Cohort 4, Cohort 5, or Cohort 6 (Section 6.3.4). Figure 4 Axicabtagene Ciloleucel Expansion and Correlations with Response and Adverse Events Table 6.

Cohort 5 In the pivotal cohorts of ZUMA-1, Phase 2 (Cohorts 1 and 2; n = 101), subjects with relapsed and refractory aggressive B-cell lymphoma were not permitted to receive anti-cancer therapy between leukapheresis and conditioning chemotherapy. However, a subsequent retrospective analysis suggested a relationship between lymphoma burden (estimated by the sum of the product of diameters [SPD] of index lesions) and clinical outcomes (Locke et al, 2018). Subjects with the lowest SPD had the highest rates of ongoing response at 1 year and the lowest rates of CRS and neurological events.  Thus, Cohort 5 will be used to prospectively assess the impact of debulking therapy, administered after leukapheresis but prior to conditioning chemotherapy, on the safety and efficacy of axicabtagene ciloleucel.  The goal of the debulking therapy will be to reduce lymphoma burden and assess clinical outcomes. Furthermore, the majority (90%) of patients with relapsed/refractory (r/r) DLBCL who were included in another CAR T-cell therapy study (KYMRIAH™ and Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation 2018) received the investigator’s choice of bridging therapy that may have had a debulking effect. Although debulking was not explicitly tested, 8 of these patients had no measurable disease following bridging therapy. The overall results from this study suggested that the inclusion of the investigator’s choice of bridging therapy was well-tolerated, as no new safety signals were identified using this approach. Toxicities observed within the JULIET study were consistent with other CD19-targeted CAR T-cell therapies. In conclusion, the goal of Cohort 5 is to improve the benefit-risk ratio of axicabtagene ciloleucel by reducing lymphoma burden prior to administration of axicabtagene ciloleucel.  This approach is justified by a retrospective analysis of outcome by tumor burden in ZUMA-1 and data from other CD19-targeting CAR T-cell products.  The specific safety regimens studied in Cohorts 3 and 4 will not be continued in Cohort 5. 6.3.4. Study Treatment by Phase Phase 1 Study The study will begin with Cohort A1.

In addition, subjects who receive doses between 1-2 x 106 anti-CD19 CAR T cells/kg will be included in the mITT analysis set.  For subjects weighing greater than CCI a CC  anti-CD19 CAR T cells will be administered. Phase 2 Safety Management Study: For Cohort 3, subjects will receive conditioning chemotherapy and axicabtagene ciloleucel as described above.  In addition, subjects will receive levetiracetam (750 mg PO or IV BID) starting on Day 0.  At the onset of ≥ Grade 2 neurologic toxicities, levetiracetam should be administered. If a subject does not experience any ≥ Grade 2 neurologic toxicities, levetiracetam should be tapered and discontinued as clinically indicated.  Subjects will also receive tocilizumab (8 mg/kg IV over 1 hour [not to exceed 800 mg]) on Day 2.  Further tocilizumab (± corticosteroids) is recommended to be administered at the onset of ≥ Grade 2 CRS. For Cohorts 4 and 6, subjects will receive bridging therapy (if applicable, refer to Section 6.2.1), conditioning chemotherapy, axicabtagene ciloleucel, and levetiracetam, as described above.  Tocilizumab will not be administered as prophylaxis, but will be administered based on toxicity management guidance (eg, tocilizumab and corticosteroids) as described in Section 6.4.1, Table 8, Table 9, and Table 10.  Corticosteroids will be initiated for toxicity management for Grade 2 CRS and for Grade 1 neurologic toxicities per Table 8 and Table 9, respectively, as described in Section 6.4.1. In addition, in Cohort 6, subjects will receive corticosteroids on CCI For Cohort 5, subjects should receive debulking therapy (refer to Section 6.2.2), conditioning chemotherapy, axicabtagene ciloleucel, and levetiracetam, as described above.
