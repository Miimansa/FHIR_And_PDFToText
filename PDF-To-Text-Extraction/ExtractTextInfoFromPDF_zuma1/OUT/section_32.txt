7.5. Neurological Assessment
For subjects enrolled in Cohort 1, Cohort 2, or Cohort 3, neurological assessments will be standardized by using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) standard version 2.0.  The MMSE neurological assessment will not be required for Phase 2 SMS Cohort 4, Cohort 5, and Cohort 6.  The MMSE is a 5-10 minute, 11-question measure that examines various areas of cognitive function: orientation, attention, immediate recall, short-term recall, language, and the ability to follow simple verbal and written commands. The MMSE is divided into two sections.  The first part requires vocal responses to the examiner's questions.  In the second part of the exam, the subject is asked to follow verbal and written instructions, write a sentence spontaneously, and copy a geometric figure.  Every attempt should be made to dedicate a single research staff member trained in the administration of the MMSE to conduct the assessment to minimize variability among different assessors. A full neurological assessment will be completed during screening to establish a baseline.  Subsequent assessments will be performed before axicabtagene ciloleucel administration on Day 0, on Day 1, and then every other day during the 7-day post-infusion monitoring period, as well as at the Week 4 and Month 3 visits.
