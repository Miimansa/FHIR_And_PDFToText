10.2. Study Endpoints
10.2.1. Primary Phase 1 study:  Incidence of adverse events defined as DLT. Phase 2 pivotal study:  ORR, defined as the incidence of either a complete response or a partial response by the revised IWG Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma (Cheson et al, 2007) as determined by the study investigators.  All subjects who do not meet the criteria for an objective response by the analysis data cutoff date will be considered non-responders. Phase 2 safety management study:  incidence and severity of CRS and neurologic toxicities. 10.2.2. Secondary Duration of response (DOR): Among subjects who experience an objective response, DOR is defined as the date of their first objective response (which is subsequently confirmed) to disease progression per the revised IWG Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma (Cheson et al, 2007) or death regardless of cause. Subjects not meeting the criteria for progression or death by the analysis data cutoff date will be censored at their last evaluable disease assessment date and their response will be noted as ongoing. ORR among subjects in Phase 1 will be summarized. ORR per Independent Radiological Review Committee (IRRC) (Phase 2):  ORR per IRRC is defined as the incidence of either a complete response or a partial response by the revised IWG Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma (Cheson et al, 2007) as determined by the IRRC.  All subjects that do not meet the criteria for an objective response by the analysis data cutoff date will be considered non-responders. Progression-free Survival (PFS): PFS is defined as the time from the axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion date to the date of disease progression per the revised IWG Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma (Cheson et al, 2007) or death from any cause.  Subjects not meeting the criteria for progression by the analysis data cutoff date will be censored at their last evaluable disease assessment date. OS:  OS is defined as the time from axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion to the date of death.  Subjects who have not died by the analysis data cutoff date will be censored at their last contact date. Incidence of adverse events and clinical significant changes in safety lab values. Incidence of anti-axicabtagene ciloleucel antibodies, levels of anti-CD19 CAR T cells in blood, and levels of cytokines in serum will be summarized. Additional Phase 2 Safety management study secondary endpoints include the following:  ORR for subjects treated in the safety management study Cohort 3, Cohort 4, Cohort 5, and Cohort 6  Changes over time in the EQ-5D scale score and EQ-5D VAS score for subjects treated in Cohort 3, Cohort 4, Cohort 5 and Cohort 6
