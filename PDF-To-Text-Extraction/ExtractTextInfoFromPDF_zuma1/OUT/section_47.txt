9.4. Reporting of Serious Adverse Events
The investigator is responsible for reporting all serious adverse events observed by the investigator or reported by the subject that occur after signing of the consent through 3 months after the axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion or until the initiation of another anticancer therapy, whichever occurs first.  After 3 months, only serious targeted adverse events (e.g., neurological, hematological, infections, autoimmune disorders, and secondary malignancies) observed by the investigator or reported by the subject will be reported for 24 months after axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion or until disease progression, whichever occurs first.   For subjects who screen fail or are enrolled but do not receive axicabtagene ciloleucel, the reporting period for serious adverse events ends 30 days after the last procedure (e.g., screen procedure, leukapheresis, conditioning chemotherapy). Serious events that the investigator assesses as related to axicabtagene ciloleucel should be reported regardless of the study period. All SAEs must be submitted via email to PPD within 24 hours following the investigatorâ€™s knowledge of the event and using a SAE Report Form. Subsequently, all serious adverse events will be reported to the health authorities per local reporting guidelines. Progression of the malignancy during the study should not be reported as a serious adverse event. Adverse events associated with disease progression may be reported as serious adverse events.  If the malignancy has a fatal outcome within 3 months of the last day of the conditioning therapy or axicabtagene ciloleucel, then the event leading to death must be recorded as a serious adverse event with CTCAE Grade 5. Death must be reported if it occurs during the serious adverse event reporting period, irrespective of any intervening treatment. Any death occurring after the first dose of chemotherapy, for the purpose of preconditioning, and within 3 months of the axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion, regardless of attribution to treatment, requires expedited reporting within 24 hours.  Any death occurring greater than 3 months after the axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion requires expedited reporting within 24 hours only if it is considered related to treatment.
