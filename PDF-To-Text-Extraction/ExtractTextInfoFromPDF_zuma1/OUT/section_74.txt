 Appendix A Revised IWG Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma (Cheson et al, 2007) Complete Remission (CR):  CR requires all of the following:  Complete disappearance of all detectable clinical evidence of disease and disease-related symptoms if present before therapy.  Typically FDG-avid lymphoma (large cell, mantle cell and follicular lymphomas are all typically FDG-avid):  in subjects with no pretreatment PET scan or when the PET scan was positive before therapy, a post-treatment residual mass of any size is permitted as long as it is PET negative.  Variably FDG-avid lymphomas/FDG avidity unknown:  in subjects without a pretreatment PET scan, or if a pretreatment PET scan was negative, all lymph nodes and nodal masses must have regressed to normal size (≤ 1.5 cm in greatest diameter if > 1.5 cm before therapy).  Previously involved nodes that were 1.1 to 1.5 cm in their long axis and more than 1 cm in their short axis before treatment must have decreased to ≤ 1.0 cm in their short axis after treatment.  The spleen and/or liver, if considered to be enlarged before therapy on basis of physical exam or CT scan, must should be normal size on CT scan and not be palpable on physical examination and nodules thought to represent lymphoma must no longer be present.  A bone marrow aspirate and biopsy is performed only when the patient had bone marrow involvement with lymphoma prior to therapy or if new abnormalities in the peripheral blood counts or blood smear cause clinical suspicion of bone marrow involvement with lymphoma after treatment.  The bone marrow aspirate and biopsy must show no evidence of disease by morphology or if indeterminate by morphology it must be negative by immunohistochemistry.  The biopsy core sample must be a minimum of 20 mm in length. Partial Remission (PR): PR requires all of the following:  ≥ 50% decrease in sum of the product of the diameters (SPD) of up to 6 of the largest dominant nodes or nodal masses.  Dominant nodes or nodal masses should be clearly measurable in at least 2 perpendicular dimensions, should be from different regions of the body if possible and should include mediastinal and retroperitoneal nodes if possible.  No increase in size of nodes, liver or spleen and no new sites of disease.  If multiple splenic and hepatic nodules are present, they must regress by ≥ 50% in the SPD.  There must be a > 50% decrease in the greatest transverse diameter for single nodules.  Bone marrow is irrelevant for determination of a PR.  If patient has persistent bone marrow involvement and otherwise meets criteria for CR the patient will be considered a PR.  Typically FDG-avid lymphoma:  for subjects with no pretreatment PET scan or if the PET scan was positive before therapy, the post-treatment PET scan should be positive in at least one previously involved site.  Note: in subjects with follicular lymphoma or mantle-cell lymphoma, a PET scan is only indicated in subjects with one or at most two residual masses that have regressed by 50% on CT scan. Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD.  PET should be positive in typically FDG-avid lymphomas. Progressive Disease: Defined by at least one of the following:  ≥ 50% increase from nadir in the sum of the products of at least two lymph nodes, or if a single node is involved at least a 50% increase in the product of the diameters of this one node.  Appearance of a new lesion greater than 1.5 cm in any axis even if other lesions are decreasing in size  Greater than or equal to a 50% increase in size of splenic or hepatic nodules  At least a 50% increase in the longest diameter of any single previously identified node more than 1 cm in its short axis.  Lesions should be PET positive in typically FDG-avid lymphomas unless the lesion is too small to be detected by PET (< 1.5 cm in its long axis by CT) Appendix B Monitoring of subjects after IP administration per country regulatory agencies: Germany: The post-infusion monitoring of subjects, described in Section 7.13.7.2 in this protocol, will be extended by monitoring on Day 8, Day 9, and Day 10, according to procedures outlined in Table 11, column “IP administration period, 1-7”. The subject may stay hospitalized or return to the clinic daily for this extended monitoring at the discretion of the investigator. The daily monitoring will include vital signs (see Section 7.4), blood draw for chemistry panel with CRP, blood draw for CBC w/differential (see Section 7.11), and neurological assessment. Any observed toxicity will be managed according to Section 6.4 of this protocol. France: The post-infusion monitoring of subjects in this protocol will be extended by monitoring on Day 8, Day 9, and Day 10, according to procedures outlined in Table 11, column “IP administration period, 1-7.” The L'Agence nationale de sécurité du médicament et des produits de santé (ANSM) recommends a 10-day hospitalization after infusion of any CAR T-cell product. The daily monitoring will include vital signs (see Section 6.4), blood draw for chemistry panel with CRP, blood draw for CBC w/differential (see Section 7.11), and neurological assessment. Any observed toxicity will be evaluated according to Section 6.4 of this protocol.
