15. PUBLICATION
Authorship of publications from data generated in study KTE-C19-101 will be determined based on the uniform requirements for manuscripts submitted to biomedical journals (as outlined in the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors December 2013) which states:  Authorship should be based on  Substantial contributions to the conception or design of the work, acquisition of data, analysis, or interpretation of data for the work; AND  Drafting the article or revising it critically for important intellectual content; AND  Final approval of the version to be published; AND  Agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work re appropriately investigated or resolved When a large, multicenter group has conducted the work, the group should identify the individual who accepts direct responsibility for the manuscript. This individual should fully meet the criteria for authorship defined above. Funding, collection of data or general supervision of the research alone or in combination does not qualify an individual for authorship. Any publication, in any form, that is derived from this study must be submitted to Kite Pharma for review and approval. The study contract between the institution, principal investigation and Kite Pharma or its delegate will outline the requirements for publication review.
