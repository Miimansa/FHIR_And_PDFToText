9. SAFETY REPORTING
9.1. Adverse Events An adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical trial subject.  The event does not necessarily have a relationship with study treatment.  The investigator is responsible for ensuring that any adverse events observed by the investigator or reported by the subject are recorded in the subject’s medical record. The definition of adverse events includes worsening of a pre-existing medical condition.  Worsening indicates that the pre-existing medical condition has increased in severity, frequency, and/or duration or has an association with a worse outcome.  A pre-existing condition that has not worsened during the study or involves an intervention such as elective cosmetic surgery or a medical procedure while on study, is not considered an adverse event. Interventions for pretreatment conditions (such as elective cosmetic surgery) or medical procedures that were planned before study participation are not considered adverse events.  Hospitalization for study treatment infusions or precautionary measures per institutional policy are not considered adverse events. The term “disease progression” as assessed by measurement of malignant lesions on radiographs or other methods should not be reported as adverse events.  Death due to disease progression in the absence of signs and symptoms should be reported as the primary tumor type (e.g., B-Cell Lymphoma). For situations when an adverse event or serious adverse event is due to the disease under investigation report the signs and symptoms.  Worsening of signs and symptoms of the malignancy under study should also be reported as adverse events in the appropriate section of the CRF. The investigators clinical judgment is used to determine whether a subject is to be removed from treatment due to an adverse event.  In the event a subject requests to withdraw from protocol required therapies or the study due to an adverse event, the subject should undergo the procedures outlined in the Month 3 visit of the SOA.
