7.4. Physical Exam, Vital Signs, Performance Status, and EQ-5D
Physical exams will be performed during screening and at times noted in the SOA.  Changes noted in subsequent exams when compared to the baseline exam will be reported as an adverse event. During IP administration, vital signs including blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, and temperature will be monitored before and after the axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion and then routinely per institutional guidelines.  If the subject has a fever (temperature 38.3oC or greater), vital signs will be monitored more frequently as clinically indicated. Performance status as measured by the ECOG scale will be performed to quantify the subjectâ€™s general well-being and ability to perform activities of daily life. For subjects enrolled in Cohort 3, Cohort 4, Cohort 5 or, Cohort 6, EQ-5D will be completed by the subject, prior to any other assessment, at the screening visit and at other times noted in the SOA.  Subjects who are blind or illiterate may have the EQ-5D questions read to them by the study staff.  The study staff, however, cannot interpret any of the questions for the subject.  A subject may be exempt from completing the questionnaire if he or she is unable to read the questionnaire in one of the country languages available. The EQ-5D is a 2 page generic patient questionnaire for assessing the overall health status of a subject.  The EQ-5D consists of a 5 dimension descriptive system including questions on mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/comfort, and anxiety/depression and a visual analogue scale (EQ VAS) which allows the respondent to record health on a vertical scale (eg, best health to worst health) thus allowing a quantitative measure of health outcome.
