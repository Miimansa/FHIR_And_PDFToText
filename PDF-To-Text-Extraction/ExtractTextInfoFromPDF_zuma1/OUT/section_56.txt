10. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
The primary objective of the Phase 1 Study is to evaluate the safety of axicabtagene ciloleucel regimens.  The primary objective of the pivotal Phase 2 portion is to evaluate the efficacy of axicabtagene ciloleucel, as measured by ORR in subjects with DLBCL, PMBCL, and TFL.  Secondary objectives will include assessing the safety and tolerability of axicabtagene ciloleucel and additional efficacy endpoints.  Inferential testing will only be performed for efficacy for Phase 2 pivotal study Cohort 1 and Cohort 2.  For the Phase 2 safety management study, Cohort 3, Cohort 4, Cohort 5, and Cohort 6, the primary objective is to assess the impact of prophylactic regimens, earlier interventions, debulking therapy, or prophylactic steroids on the rate and severity of CRS and neurologic toxicities.
